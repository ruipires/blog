<p>Just finished listening to another video I saved in my <a href="http://getpocket.com/">pocket list</a>.<br />
It was a talk on <a href="https://developers.google.com/events/io/">google IO</a> 2012, about WebRTC and specifically, the new getUserMedia API.</p>
<p>This has made the right side of my brain tingle. I think I see a project idea coming up, and it seems fun!<br />
I hope I'll have something to show soon ;)</p>
<p>You can find the original article <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2012/07/introducing-getusermedia-and-javascript.html">here</a>, and the original video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8C8ouiXHHk">here</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/E8C8ouiXHHk" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>Note: the presentation is a bit slow paced, but that just gave me time to keep thinking of what to do with all that wonderful technology!</p>
