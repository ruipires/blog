<p>Back in 2012 I tweeted this:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Is there a c++/java dictionary? Stuff like this would make sense for teaching new languages to programmers. Languages do overlap a lot.</p>&mdash; ruipires (@ruipires) <a href="https://twitter.com/ruipires/status/231035031148187649">August 2, 2012</a></blockquote><br />
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>I could have tried doing it myself, but couldn't find the time for it. This is a recurring problem of mine. I have new ideas faster than I can execute them.</p>
<p>Now, I stumbled upon <a href="http://hyperpolyglot.org/">Hyperpolyglot</a> (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/hyperpolyglot-is-a-side-by-side-reference-sheet-for-pro-1693865053">thank you lifehacker</a>), that does more or less what I had thought of at the time.</p>
<p>It is a dictionary that shows you the similarities and differences of each language inside a "family".</p>
<p>Lets hope they add the ability to mix and match what languages are shown side by side.<br />
It would be harder to implement, but might prove a lot more useful, when trying to go to a language where you can do things the same way, but that is not the best way of doing them there.<br />
I am thinking about something like showing Python and C++ side by side. If I use Python with a C++ mindset, things can certainly work, but they will not be optimal. It would be great if this could leverage my C++ knowledge, but show me how and where to be more Pythonic. The same ideia obviously applies to other language combinations.</p>
