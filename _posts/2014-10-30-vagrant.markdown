<p>After hearing about it a <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/2014/07/episode-207-mitchell-hashimoto-on-the-vagrant-project/">software engineering radio episode</a>, and in several other podcasts/articles (<a href="http://twit.tv/show/floss-weekly">FLOSS weekly</a> maybe?), I decided to try using <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">vagrant</a>.</p>
<p>Vagrant describes itself as a way to "Create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments".</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-469"></a>From my current (limited) understanding of it, it describes a development environment (for most use cases, this is a virtual machine that we will use to test our project on). This description is in fact&nbsp;a Vagrantfile that is created when you initialise your project with the vagrant init command.</p>
<p>In the Vagrantfile you can specify what "box"&nbsp;your virtual machine will be based on, port forwarding rules, if the virtual machine should run in headless mode or if you need a GUI, etc. This file is typically checked-in with your code, so that a new developer can just type vagrant up and have a fully working test environment.</p>
<p>Vagrant refers to base virtual machines as boxes. The simplest way is to just use a pre-made one from their <a href="http://vagrantcloud.com">site</a>, but you can also import a box from a VirtualBox virtual machine and use that.</p>
<p>You can ssh into the virtual machine with a simple "vagrant ssh" command, and the folder where the Vagrantfile is located is shared with the virtual machine (you can access it in /vagrant). All very developer friendly (I was doing all this manually until now!).</p>
<p>Vagrant is typically used for web development, but given that it supports several types of providers (what actually runs the VM), I can see it being used for other use cases as well.</p>
<p>The default provider is VirtualBox, but you can install more. The <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> and kvm/<a href="www.qemu.org">qemu</a> providers caught my eye, and I will most likely take them for a spin sometime soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I'm very glad I gave vagrant a try.</p>
