<p>A few hours before 2015 it dawned on me, and I couldn't help it but share it with those&nbsp;around me: 2015 in binary is 1111101111 which is a palindromic number.</p>
<p>It seems this is not as interesting for a non geek crowd as I'd expect, but I found it interesting&nbsp;nonetheless.</p>
<p>Happy 11111011111 everyone!</p>
