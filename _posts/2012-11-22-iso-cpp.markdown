<p>If you are into C++ programming (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=modern+c%2B%2B">the modern kind</a>), and dont know <a href="http://isocpp.org">isocpp.org</a>, you&nbsp;definitively&nbsp;should.</p>
<p><a href="http://isocpp.org">isocpp</a> stands for "Standard C++ Foundation" and is a not-for-profit organization, founded by a bunch of companies/organizations you might recognize:</p>
<p>ARM, BD Software,&nbsp;Bloomberg,&nbsp;Dinkum Ware,&nbsp;DRW Trading group,&nbsp;Google, HP,&nbsp;HSA Foundation,&nbsp;IBM,&nbsp;Intel,&nbsp;Microsoft, OpenMP,&nbsp;Pearson,&nbsp;Plum Hall, Symbio, Vollmann Engineering.</p>
<p>Not to mention the directors and officers of the organization, that include some names I highly respect and look up to.</p>
<p>The goal is</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;to support the C++ software developer community and promote the understanding and use of modern Standard C++ on all compilers and platforms.</blockquote></p>
<div>Sounds great to me!</div>
