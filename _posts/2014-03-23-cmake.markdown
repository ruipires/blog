  content: "People prefer to buy expensive carpet cleaning machines to help them in
    cleaning without knowing the fact that \r\nthese are not as effective as professional
    cleaners or steam cleaner rentals.\r\nNot all janitorial service companies will
    be \r\nprospects who can provide the kind, frequency and volume of cleaning \r\nservices
    you necessitate; as an example, if you function in a \r\nhealth-related clinic,
    you'll need to hire someone that can tend \r\nto your unique needs or have prior
    experience in another comparable setting.\r\nThe best thing about these cleaning
    services \r\nis that these are not just limited to rich and high class people."

  content: "Consummate carpet care business plans will focus on choosing the right
    business segment, advance budgeting and financing plans, and a well defined marketing,
    advertising and operational strategy.\r\nFor example, updating an inventory to
    new sets of data to remove mean that there can be 15-25% cost reduction. Cleaning
    in schools includes \r\nboth inside and outside buildings, in addition to glass,
    recreational areas and bathrooms."

<p>Another page on the <a title="Battle of the build systems" href="http://www.sennin.pt/2012/05/29/battle-of-the-build-systems/">battle of build systems</a>, I am now moving on to CMake, after giving SCons a try.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://ryppl.org/">ryppl</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> project by </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://daveabrahams.com/">Dave Abrahams</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> et al to give the C++ community a tool to be able to leverage recent technology to provide us composable, portable C++ libraries (mostly from the developer perspective) got me re-thinking if I should be settling with a tool that would make me implement all of what I needed for each new project.</span></p>
<p>They have decided to base their tool on CMake, so I decided to start using that while ryppl is not available. This way I get to learn a new tool that has a very wide user base, and maybe I'll learn enough about it that I can try and make some contributions to the ryppl project.</p>
<p>I got the basic working by porting one of my pet project from using SCons to CMake, but then I stumbled on the ExternalProject module. That allows us to specify a remote project (zip, tarball, SVN repo, Git repo, etc) and cmake will download, configure, compile and install it.</p>
<p>There are ways to control each of theses steps. I normally like to keep project dependencies on the project tree, to avoid having my machine filled with development packages installed in a central location (just thinking of juggling incompatible versions for different projects sends chills down my spine). To do this I can just make the packages be installed locally, or just inhibit the install step altogether.</p>
<p>But I do have my complains about CMake.</p>
<p>I find the syntax awkward. The documentation is not very well structured for a beginner (I've seen worse). There is no way to enforce some rules, so if I depend on the findXYZ library macros, there is no way for sure to know what was set in default properties until I try them out.</p>
<p>But luckily, the big user base is a really a boon for us. I got google test to be fecthed by CMake, compiled locally use it in my project thanks to <a href="https://gist.github.com/oneamtu/3734295">this github gist</a> from&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/oneamtu <a href="https://gist.github.com/oneamtu">oneamtu</a>.</p>
<p>Next step: try to start using the <a href="https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/CMakeModularizationStatus">CMake version of Modular Boost.</a></p>
