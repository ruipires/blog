<p>Developed in 2004/2005, as my final college project, this was a car simulator (i.e. game, with little game mechanics) featuring vehicle deformation.</p>
<p>The game was developed using <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org">Ogre3D</a>, an open source, but highly capable 3D graphics engine for the graphics. We used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novodex">NovodeX </a>(later aquired by Ageia, and then by Nvidia which rebranded it as <a href="http://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/physx">PhysX</a>), for the physics simulation.</p>
<p>The game featured networked multiplayer mode, and supported <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_Automatic_Virtual_Environment">CAVE </a>projection mode (using multiple surrounding projectors with adjusted point of view corrections in each one).</p>
<p>The deformation was the basis of our work, and was published as a paper. You can read the preprint version <a href="http://www.sennin.pt/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/d4md_preprint.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>The name was meant as a play on the word Deformed (D - four- MD), a nod to the deformation system that was the core of this game.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=11962">post</a>&nbsp;about the game was made in the Ogre3D forums.</p>
