<p>Hi, my name is Rui Pires.</p>
<p>I am a Portuguese software engineer living in a small volcanic island called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terceira_Island">Terceira</a>, located in the <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&z=12&ll=38.72543,-27.196999&spn=0.154278,0.385208&t=h&om=1">middle</a> of the Atlantic Ocean, in the <a href="http://www.visitazores.com/en">Azores</a>.</p>
<p>I'm currently working remotely since 2012.</p>
<p>You can see some of my side projects in the <a href="http://www.sennin.pt/projects">projects</a> page.</p>
<p>If you are curious, you can look at my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/ruidpires">LinkedIn profile</a>, follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ruipires">Twitter</a> or take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/ruipires">GitHub page</a>.</p>
<p>I started programming in 1998, and have been fascinated with it ever since.</p>
<p>I'm interested in modern C++, and have a particularly soft spot for indie game development. Indie Game development fascinates me because it requires a wide array of knowledge in different areas of computing (graphics, network, AI, UI, scripting, physics, etc), not to mention how satisfying it is to create something that is simply fun.</p>


<p>You might be wondering what the name "sennin" is all about.</p>
<p>Sennin (仙人) is a Japanese word (loaned from Chinese), with several possible translations.
I have chosen it for one in particular: Hermit.</p>
<p>If I wanted to continue living here I had to choose to only work remotely. I do, thankfully, communicate with the outside world a lot more than the typical hermit.</p>
