  project. I like how it promisses, and can deliver the capability to develop a cross
  platform UI.\r\n\r\nThat being said, if there is one thing that can set one application
  apart from the others, is attention to detail. I include in that looking and behaving
  as any other native (native only, that is) application."

<p>It is no secret that I am a fan of the <a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt</a> project. I like how it promisses, and can deliver the capability to develop a cross platform UI.</p>
<p>That being said, if there is one thing that can set one application apart from the others, is attention to detail. I include in that looking and behaving as any other native (native only, that is) application.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-484"></a></p>
<p>I have been using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePass">KeePass</a> to handle my passwords, and I enjoy how there&nbsp;are applications for every major platform (<a href="https://www.keepassx.org/">windows, OS X</a>, <a href="http://www.keepassdroid.com/">android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/passdrop/id431185109?mt=8">iOS</a>).</p>
<p>I was starting to get annoyed at how KeePassX <a href="https://www.keepassx.org/screenshots/">looks under OS X</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sennin.pt/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mac1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-487" src="http://www.sennin.pt/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mac1.jpg" alt="mac1" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>I have found a project on github that promised a OS X native client for kdb files called <a href="https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass">MacPass</a>. They are using a github feature I had no idea existed: they have pre-built binaries available for <a href="https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass/releases">download</a>.</p>
<p>Here's how it looks:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sennin.pt/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MacPass.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-485" src="http://www.sennin.pt/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MacPass.png" alt="MacPass" width="794" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That looks much nicer! At least it blends in nicely with the other OS X applications.</p>
<p>Here's what I liked about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports full screen mode</li>
<li>Has a nice looking icon</li>
<li>Searching is easy (using the keyboard only)</li>
<li>Double clicking on the username copies it to the clipboard</li>
<li>Conversely, double clicking on the password copies it to the clipboard</li><br />
</ul><br />
I know these as tiny differences, but I use this application so much that they add up after some time.</p>
<p>Also, I'm a sucker for eye candy.</p>
